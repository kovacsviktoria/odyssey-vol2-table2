## Story

You've got a mail from your client's beloved UI designer:

Subject:	Re: ui build done

Hi Fellas,

I know I should have created the menu design and the mobile/tablet version till yesterday but I've got awesome waves can't go back to work.
But I checked your build and wow, that's sick mate! I'm amazed!
So I'm pretty sure that you can handle the menu and the device versions without my design.

Cheers
Pat

Unfortunately, without UI design you have to solve the responsivity of your previous UI build.
Also you have to make the menu as well.
Your client asked for the following items in the menu: `About`, `The Route`, `Our Team`, `Join Us`, `FAQ`, `Contact`, `Impress`

## What are you going to learn?

- Make a layout responsive
â€“ JavaScript controlled CSS animations
- Using a JavaScript Library

## Tasks

1. Make the page responsive.
    - The layout looking good and remains legible on all screen sizes from smaller devices to bigger screens.

2. Make the menu icon clickable. When someone click on it shows up a list of the menu items. The links don't have to link anywhere.
    - The cursor changes to pointer if we hover over the menu icon
    - When we click on the menu icon, a list with the menu items shows up and the `<body>` become unscrollable
    - The menu icon animates into an X icon and the appereance (and disappereance) of the menu toggles

3. Make the gallery swipable.
    - The Swiper.js library is in the `<head>` of the index-html.
    - The gallery is swipable with the help of Swiper.js library.
    - The `prev`, the `next` buttons and the `pagination` are functioning with the help of Swiper.js library.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You can change all the sizes of the contents and `<svg>`s, when the layout is getting smaller
- You can make the gallery swipable with Swiper.js
